This is a repo of all my tools as a backup if I ever have a new instance of Kali for whatever reason and wish to install my tools again for ease.

You guys can download as you wish and add to your own arsenal of toolkits ! It will be good help in Hack The Box as this is what I mainly do
at the moment, and it would probably be useful for OSCP aswell :D
